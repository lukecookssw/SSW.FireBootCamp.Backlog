# Definition of Done

- Code compiles without errors or warnings
- Check all GitHub tasks on the PBI are completed (if any)
- Check all Acceptance Criteria on the PBI have been met (if any)
- Code is squash-merged into main via a pull request that was approved by a 2nd developer
- Use @mentions (or send an email) to notify the Product Owner and PBI stakeholders that the PBI is done (**remember**: include screenshots and/or a 'Done' video as proof)
